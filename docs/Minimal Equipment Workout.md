### Below are two ways to test your grip strength and three exercises to include in your training plan to improve it.

#### Grip Strength Test 1: Dead Hang Hold

How long can you hold from a pull-up bar until your forearms start burning, or your grip gives out and you peel right off?

- Less than 30 seconds: F
- 45 seconds to 1 minute: C +
- 1 to 2 minutes: B
- 2 -3 minutes: A --
- 3 minutes or more: A +

#### Grip Strength Test 2: Farmer Carry

Can you farmer carry with your body weight (50 percent in each hand) for 50 meters without stopping?

If not, work toward the goal of a bodyweight farmer carry by including the following three exercises in your training plan.

**Grip Strength Exercise 1: Farmer Carry Hold**

With a kettlebell or dumbbell in each hand, stand with perfect posture with the weights in the farmer carry position for 1 minute.

- Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute as heavy as possible.

**Grip Strength Exercise 2: Plate Pinch Hold or Walk**

Do the same as above holding on to 15-25lb plates, or even two if you can manage it. You can also do these as a walking plate pinch.

- Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute or 3 sets of a 40-60-meter walk.

![Plate Pinch Hold](https://breakingmuscle.com//wp-content/uploads/2019/09/platehold.jpeg "Plate Pinch Hold")

**Grip Strength Exercise 3: Dumbbell Head Hold**

Place two DBs on their ends and pick them up by their head. Hold a farmer carry position this way.

- Work up to 3 sets of 30 seconds to one minute hold.

![Dumbbell Head Hold](https://breakingmuscle.com//wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dumbbellhold.jpeg "Dumbbell Head Hold")

**Bonus Grip Exercise: Towel Chin-Ups**

This one is a fairly higher level movement, but if you have the strength, toss a towel over the bar and hold onto the towel as you pull your chin over the bar into a pull-up. The [Rope Towel Pull Ups movement is demonstrated here](https://breakingmuscle.com/rope-towel-pull-ups/) as part of the [Breaking Muscle Movement Library](https://breakingmuscle.com/tag/movement-library/).

Keeping your chest tall and core tight, hold a pair of dumbbells and throw your hips back, then pop your hips forward and clean the weight up to your shoulders. Squat down until your hips are parallel to the floor, then drive through the heels and explode up. Use the momentum of the squat to press the weight up, then lower it back down to starting position before performing another rep.

### Plank

"The muscles in our core that engage when we place lateral loads onto our core and midsection, they don't get trained very well with other common sagittal plane [front-to-back movement] exercises," Filly says. To build up that part of your core, flip onto your side for a plank.

Just make sure that your form is on point. Filly cautions against compensating by bending your hips and rolling your top shoulder forward. Again, a straight line is what you want. Really want to work? Tap your hip to the ground or add some weight.

### Turkish getup

"This move puts the regular situp to shame," says Filly of this offshoot of [the Turkish getup](https://apple.news/AbSkkGF9QRu-lDHdNHU2QBA "‌"), which gives your core and your shoulder some work. Work your way up to using a weight.

"As you do this exercise, you need to be sure that you initiate from the floor by pressing up hard through the kettlebell and/or the dumbbell," he says. "This is going to engage a muscle called the [serratus anterior](https://apple.news/A8juVG4unSSSr58IrGQbJFg "‌")."

### L-Hang

[![Squat Univ Abs](https://img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=)shorts/WWFSuHvmsRo

Filly loves hanging variations to train the core. (Not sure how to hang properly for proper tension? Check out our [Form Check guide](https://apple.news/Apg_OEUdJTfKloUl41g1mcg "‌") for some tips on the first part of this move.)

Before you jump to the L-hang, Filly recommends starting with a tuck hang for 30 seconds, then adding weight between your legs. No pullup bar? No problem. Use some parallettes instead.

### Hollow Body Hold

### Butterfly sit-ups

Butterfly sit-ups remove your hips from the equation, fully loading your ab muscles during the exercise. Sit-ups target the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and internal and external obliques, making the move a total ab attack. Having a wall in front of you helps support your feet and forces you to reach forward at the top, achieving a fuller range of motion.
