## rhomboids

- **Chest-Supported Rows:**
  - Lie face down on an incline bench, holding dumbbells.
  - Row the dumbbells towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

**Calisthenics Exercises:**

- **Inverted Rows:**
  - Find a sturdy bar, like a pull-up bar or a sturdy table.
  - Hang from the bar with your arms straight, feet on the ground.
  - Pull your chest towards the bar, squeezing your shoulder blades together.
- **Scapular Push-ups:**
  - Start in a push-up position.
  - Lower your body towards the ground, then push back up, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Focus on Squeezing Your Shoulder Blades:** This is the key to activating your rhomboids.
- **Maintain Proper Form:** Avoid rounding your back, as this can lead to injury.
- **Start with Lighter Weights or Easier Variations:** Gradually increase the difficulty as you get stronger.
- **Incorporate These Exercises into Your Workout Routine:** Aim for 2-3 times per week.
- **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience any pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.

By consistently performing these exercises, you can strengthen your rhomboids and improve your posture.

## Pull-ups

- Pull-ups are a great compound exercise that works the rhomboids, along with other back muscles.
