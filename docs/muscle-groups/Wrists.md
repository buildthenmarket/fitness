### Dead Hang

Simply hang from a pull-up bar with arms fully extended. Great for grip endurance and shoulder health.

### Towel Chin-Ups

This one is a fairly higher level movement, but if you have the strength, toss a towel over the bar and hold onto the towel as you pull your chin over the bar into a pull-up. The [Rope Towel Pull Ups movement is demonstrated here](https://breakingmuscle.com/rope-towel-pull-ups/) as part of the [Breaking Muscle Movement Library](https://breakingmuscle.com/tag/movement-library/).
