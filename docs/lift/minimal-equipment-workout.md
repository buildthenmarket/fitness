### Turkish Getup

"This move puts the regular situp to shame," says Filly of this offshoot of [the Turkish getup](https://apple.news/AbSkkGF9QRu-lDHdNHU2QBA "‌"), which gives your core and your shoulder some work. Work your way up to using a weight.

"As you do this exercise, you need to be sure that you initiate from the floor by pressing up hard through the kettlebell and/or the dumbbell," he says. "This is going to engage a muscle called the [serratus anterior](https://apple.news/A8juVG4unSSSr58IrGQbJFg "‌")."
